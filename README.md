# Tax Lien Certificate Sale Properties â€“ Baltimore

## Project Overview

This project explores **Baltimore properties sold during tax lien certificate sales** using a combination of data analytics, statistical methods, and visualizations. The aim is to uncover patterns, identify real estate investment opportunities, and provide insights that can assist policymakers and local governments in understanding the social and economic impacts of these sales.

Tax lien certificate sales represent a unique window into the **local housing market, tax collection processes, and neighborhood dynamics**. This dataset provides a valuable resource for real estate investors, government bodies, and researchers.

##  Key Insights
- In this project, I analyzed Baltimore's tax lien certificate sale data to uncover patterns in property types, neighborhood-level sales concentration, and seasonal sales trends through manual data cleaning in Excel, I standardized and prepared the dataset for deeper analysis. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and R (ggplot2), I performed exploratory data analysis and created visualizations that revealed a higher frequency of sales in economically challenged neighborhoods, a dominance of vacant and multi-unit properties in lien sales, and notable seasonal peaks aligned with auction cycles. 
- Additionally, I explored public visibility metrics to understand the role of influential entities in shaping public interest. This multi-tool approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of how tax delinquency and property risk factors vary across geography and time, offering valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and urban developers.
- Using a combination of manual data cleaning (Excel), statistical grouping (Python, R), and visual storytelling (Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2), I uncovered spatial, categorical, and temporal insights about Baltimore's tax lien sales. These insights can support decision-making for:

- Real estate investors looking for undervalued property zones
- Policymakers aiming to reduce tax delinquency rates
- Urban planners working on equitable housing development

##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how local property sale data from tax lien certificates can be leveraged for **market analysis, investment planning, and policy recommendations**. My work provides a foundation for future research in urban housing trends and serves as a decision-support tool for both investors and public institutions.
